# APB UART (HAS) #

## Summary ##
APB UART Design is an untested design for the purpose of learning/testing. APB Uart is a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transciever) that is designed to be incorporated into a SOC. 
This is made possible by implementing the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol in order to configure the UART via 4 CSR (Control status registers).
